## Introduction
Cross-entropy loss is a crucial metric in training neural networks for classification tasks. This repository provides an example of using cross-entropy loss for both binary and multiclass classification, helping models learn to predict the correct labels with higher confidence.

## Installation
To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cross-entropy-loss.git
cd cross-entropy-loss
pip install -r requirements.txt


Usage
To run the cross-entropy loss example, follow these steps:

Prepare your dataset and place the data in the data directory.

Run the main.py script to compute the cross-entropy loss for your dataset:
python main.py

Results
The results of the cross-entropy loss computation will be saved in the results directory. You can visualize the loss values and evaluate the performance of your model.
